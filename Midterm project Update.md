# Project Update

In the past few weeks, I have continued to look into AV1 video codec, and the GPUs used in the NVIDIA Now data servers. I have been looking at a more technical overview
of both AV1, how frames are partitioned into blocks and how the blocks are then transformed and quantized and finally entropy encoded, and the Ada GPU architecture, what
encoders are used as well as how parallelism is achieved. 

# Changes to my Topic

Originally, I was looking at NVIDIA Now in terms of reducing latency while maintaining or improving quality and user usability. This is still the premise of the 
project, however, I have now split the analysis into two parts. 

The first is to do with the new RTX 4000 series graphics cards. This encompasses AV1 encoders as well as the Ada architecture. In addition to this, the graphics
cards include new-generation RT cores, Tensor cores, and CUDA cores all of which lend a helping hand to the latency and quality problems. This new encompassed topic 
would also allow me to mention the newest version of deep learning super sampling or DLSS 3 and vision AI acceleration which is included in the Ada architecture. Going 
forward I would include these in the analysis of NVIDIA Now.

I wanted to note that I thought that the Ada Lovelace was the actual GPU, but it is in fact just the architecture of the RTX 4000 series GPU. Now, graphics cards are often defined by the architecture which makes them up, but I thought that interchanging the RTX 4000 series GPU and the Ada Lovelace Architecture was mischaracterizing. In any case, I wanted to broaden that aspect and talk about the RTX 4000s which follows the Ada architecture which INCLUDES all the previously mentioned components.

The second part will consist of the NVIDIA Reflex and its corresponding sdk for optimizing and measuring latency in cloud gaming. NVIDIA Reflex is, in a way, a 
combination of hardware and software which is used to optimize the latency for a userâ€™s device by monitoring input registration times and network traffic. I will
further split this topic into two different aspects, network latency and system latency, and will go through what NVIDIA Reflex does to minimize these as well as how
effective it is in doing this.

After the analysis of these two core components, I will discuss the effects that these two have on the latency, quality, and user accessibility in general, taking 
into account all aspects at the same time.

# Overview of Research

### AV1

Starting with the AV1 codec, I learned about how video is actually compressed. The flow is seemingly similar to previous video encoders as seen in the image below,

but there are many differences in the way each step is performed and the many more options for each step as well. For example, the image below shows the ways to partition the frame into blocks. Noticing the max block size increased from 64x64 in the VP9(*) codec to 128x128 in AV1 and there are more ways to recursively split the block in AV1 than in VP9.

All of the additions to partitioning, as mentioned above, prediction, both inter and intra, transformation, quantization, filtering, and entropy encoding that are added in AV1 will be talked about in the project. The research I have done so far is from technical blog posts from NVIDIA, information talks from Alliance for Open Media consortium (the creaters of AV1), and some research papers done on AV1. Aspects from all will be included in the project for more depth of knowledge.

### RTX 4000 Ada GPU

A single slot graphics card with many advantages over its predecessors. The image below expresses briefly the advantages the Ada GPUs have over an older one.

This will be explored in more depth for the project. I will talk about the specifics of each part of the graphics cards and the advantages they bring to the cloud gaming experience. NVIDIA have released a white paper and many blog posts on the cards, so information from those will be included in this section.

# NVIDIA Reflex

The area I have started to research is the Reflex sdk used by NVIDIA for latency analysis. With this, NVIDIA can optimize your setup to reduce latency. They explain that the total latency when playing is due to both system and network latency. Looking at the image taken from the NVIDIA website, the proposed effects of Reflex on various games compared to without.

(*) VP9 is most recent video compression algorithm prior to AV1 and is still used a lot today. Many sources compare AV1 to it.
