# Final Project Update

The final result of the project consists of a review of the various aspects of NVIDIA GeForce Now. It focuses specifically on the Ultimate tier of the platform as it includes the most interesting and future oriented qualities that are important to talk about. The topics covered in the report are NVIDIAâ€™s RTX 4080 graphics cards which are used in the NVIDIA servers and the various hardware and software components that make up the graphics cards architecture. There is a lot to that can be talked about for each of these topics, but instead, the report provides a surface level description of each and then relates each feature to an increase in the overall quality of the platform.

For a deeper look into all of the previously mentioned components then all of the links to the resources I used can be found below or on the last page of the report. 

For any deep learning enthusiasts, I would especially look into DLSS 3 and 3.5, which are briefly talked about in the report. As for anybody interested in video compression and algorithms regarding it, a creator of AV1 gave a great lecture on the different components of AV1 which can be found at (11) in the sources section.

# My Thoughts on the Report

I am very happy with the report. Researching all the different aspects of the platform was interesting and I found that I had too much detail to compress into the page limit in the final report. However, this could be due to my scope being a little too broad which perhaps resulted in some confusion regarding how each component functions. Regardless, I am certain that all the segments of the report are important and lend a great deal to the success of the platform. 

I  was concerned about the level of personal experience that I incorporated into the report as I only had access to the free tier, but I supplemented this with second hand accounts of others using the ultimate and the priority tiers and used their feedback instead.
